<h1>Mr Fat and Mr Thin and other comics 

</h1>

<p>This is mr.fat and mr.thin and it is a buncha comix that I wrote.I hope you will enjoy them.

The comix are usally goodish and the BEST ones are on my website!Also, most of them are violent so 9+ is recomended.For overactive parents,take care to leave the computer on at night.
